# Question 8: Longest Repetition

# Define a procedure, longest_repetition, that takes as input a 
# list, and returns the element in the list that has the most 
# consecutive repetitions. If there are multiple elements that 
# have the same number of longest repetitions, the result should 
# be the one that appears first. If the input list is empty, 
# it should return None.

def longest_repetition(a):     
 dictionary = {}
 for t in a:
  i = 0
  for u in a:
    if t==u:
      i += 1
      dictionary[t] = i
 print dictionary
 maxi = 0
 for x in dictionary:
   if dictionary[x] > maxi:
     maxi = dictionary[x]
 return x
   
      



#For example,

print longest_repetition([1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1])
# 3

print longest_repetition(['a', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'd', 'd'])
# b

print longest_repetition([1,2,3,4,5])
# 1

#print longest_repetition([])
# None
